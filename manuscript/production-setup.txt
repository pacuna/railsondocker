# Production setup

One of the reasons why a lot of people enjoy using tools like Kubernetes
and ECS, is because their integration with Cloud Providers.
It can be very challenging to configure a cluster by hand, even if you use
modern tools like Kubernetes. You have to configure the way your nodes
are going to join the cluster and communicate to each other, the service
discovery mechanism and the integration with the extra tools the Cloud offers, like
load balancing and persistent storages.

With Kubernetes and ECS, you can launch a cluster without worry about this issues.
Even if you want to build a high-availability cluster, distributed among several regions, 
you'll have high level tools for accomplish that without having to deep to heavy into
networking issues.

In this section we're going to install an essential dependency that's going to allow
Kubernetes and AWS to manage our resources for us. This tools is called AWS Command
Line Interface (aws cli for short) and allows the interaction with all the services
available in our AWS account.

If you don't have an AWS account, you can go to the [official page](https://aws.amazon.com/)
and create one now. It's going to be necessary for the following steps.
Keep in mind although you have a free-tier for some resource until certain limits, we are going
to be using resources that don't fall into that category, so you will be billed
for the time you run this resources, but don't worry. You can launch as many servers, Load Balancers, 
or S3 buckets you want, and you'll have a small bill as long you deleted all after you're done.

## Installing the AWS CLI

The [official documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html)
discuses several methods to install the tool according to your operating system.
Once dependency that you would need on your system is python.

In my case I'm using MacOs. If you're also using MacOs or linux, you can
use the `AWS CLI Bundled Installer` and install aws on your system with
the following commands:

    $ curl "https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws-cli/awscli-bundle.zip" -o "awscli-bundle.zip"
    $ unzip awscli-bundle.zip
    $ sudo ./awscli-bundle/install -i /usr/local/aws -b /usr/local/bin/aws

If you're on windows, you would have to use `pip` and install the `awscli` package.

After running those commands, I can run:

    $ aws --version

Output:

    aws-cli/1.10.66 Python/2.7.10 Darwin/16.0.0 botocore/1.4.56

So I have the tool correctly installed.

## Configuring the AWS CLI

Before configuring the AWS CLI, you need to get an access key and secret access key
for your account. This are personal tokens that will allow third-party applications or
the AWS CLI, to manage resources on your behalf.
In order to get this tokens, go to the [documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/managing-aws-access-keys.html)
and follow the steps. This shouldn't take too long since all the process
gets done via the AWS graphical interface.

Once you have you tokens, go back to your console and run:

    $ aws configure

    AWS Access Key ID [None]: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    AWS Secret Access Key [None]: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    Default region name [None]: us-east-1
    Default output format [None]: json

And add your own configuration. It's also a good idea to set the default region
immediately so you don't have to put with every command you run.

After running this command, you're credentials will be save under `~/.aws/credentials`:

    [default]
    aws_access_key_id = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    aws_secret_access_key = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

And your configuration under `/.aws/config`:

    [default]
    output = json
    region = us-east-1

In case you wonder, `default` is your default profile. You can have several
profiles which are associated to different AWS accounts. So for example, you can
configure a profile for work, an another that's personal by using different sections
in the files:

    [default]
    aws_access_key_id = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    aws_secret_access_key = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

    [work]
    aws_access_key_id = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    aws_secret_access_key = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

The default profile will be used if don't specify any when running commands.
If you want to run commands using an specific profile, you just have to
add the flag `--profile another-profile` to every command.

Now that we have this tool configured, Kubernetes can use it for launching our cluster, 
and we can also use it for managing our ECS resources.

All the operations that you do with the AWS CLI can also be done using the graphical interface.
The big advantage of using the CLI is that you can save your commands for avoiding
repetition and also you can automate almost everything you want. So for example, you can
create a Load Balancer by following a Wizard and repeat that process for all the Load Balancers you need, 
or you can figure out how to do it by using the AWS CLI, save that command and run it
every time you need a new one.
