# Introduction

There are a lot of different container orchestration platforms out there. Every one
of them has a different set of features that set them apart.
Choose one of these platforms can be a complex task. You have to dig into the specifics
of each one of these to see if you like the concepts and the ways behind the framework.
It's almost impossible to judge them without trying them for a while.
Sadly not many people have the time to try every one of the current alternatives.

On top of that problem, people spend a lot of time figuring out out to deploy an specific
application using containers. Every web application framework out there requires
different configuration, different initialization steps and different tasks
to run updates. Even though there are some practices in the world of containers that could
be considered as standards, the differences between the applications always creates a new
problem that has to be solved in a custom way. And for this, it's critical to choose
an orchestration platform that supports for all of these requirements and that provides
the tools to create a smooth workflow when running updates.
In this books you'll find steps to deploy a specific type of applications, Rails web applications.
If you are a Rails developer, you should be pretty familiarized with the typical steps
to run a Rails application on development and on production.
If you don't use Rails, this books should also give you valuable information on how
to create templates to run tasks and web application using Docker and Kubernetes and ECS
for deployment.

After you choose the right platform to deploy your application, you have to deal
with the issue of running the whole infrastructure. You have to create and manage a cluster
of nodes and be able to add or remove nodes when necessary. In this book you'll see
how Kubernetes and ECS deal with this task in a very transparent way. You can launch
an entire cluster with a couple of commands and without being an expert in issue
like networking or DNS.

Once you have your application up and running, you can build a Continuous Integration
pipeline around it. The whole idea of this it to be able to run deployments very often
without having downtime and making sure that we are not pushing bad code. Automated testing is 
a big part in this structure. We should be able to run our test suite before sending our
code to production servers. For that we also have several alternatives out there.
Here we are going to be using Jenkins as our CI server. Jenkins is a classical choice
when it comes to CI. It's highly configurable and it plays nice with tools we need, such as
Docker, Kubernetes and AWS.

You should take the information given in this book as a set of ideas on how to
implement your deployment pipelines. You're application it's going to be different, you might
have more dependencies or it's going to require more build steps. But at the end
as a long you understand how to apply the basic concepts behind containers, and specially
Kubernetes and ECS, you'll be able to create pipelines for any application.
In the book you'll find example scripts, templates, shell commands and a lot of
other information that should help you to build your system.

# About the book

- This book is all about ideas. You app will certainly be different
- What are we going to deploy
- Conventions (simbology)
- How to use the book (recommend reading both, k8s and ECS sections)
